"""
This file implements the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for solving a game problem.
It explores the state space by going as deep as possible along a branch before backtracking.
The algorithm uses a stack for state management and tracks explored states to avoid revisiting them.
It does not guarantee the shortest path but can be memory-efficient compared to BFS.

Returns:
- path: A list of moves if a solution is found, or [] if not.
- nodes_explored: How many states were analyzed.
- max_depth: The maximum depth explored.

    """
    This function performs Depth-First Search (DFS).
    It explores the state space by going as deep as possible along a branch before backtracking.

    How does it work?
    - Uses a 'stack' (LIFO: Last In, First Out).
    - Removes the most recently added state from the stack.
    - Generates all its neighbors (states 1 move away).
    - If a neighbor has never been visited, marks it as visited and adds it to the *top* of the stack.

    Returns:
        - path: A list of moves if a solution is found, or [] if not.
        - nodes_explored: How many states were analyzed.
        - max_depth: The maximum depth explored.
