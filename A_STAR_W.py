# Description: Implementation of Weighted A* (Weighted A-Star) Search algorithm with heuristic selection.

#--------------------------------------------

"""
This file implements the Weighted A* (Weighted A-Star) Search algorithm for solving a game problem.
Weighted A* is a variation of A* that prioritizes the heuristic (h) by applying a weight to it.
This makes the algorithm faster but sacrifices optimality.

Returns:
    - path: The list of moves if a solution is found, or [] if not.
    - nodes_explored: The number of states analyzed.
    - max_depth: The maximum depth explored within the given time limit.
