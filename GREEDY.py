# Description: Implementation of Greedy Search algorithm with heuristic selection.

#--------------------------------------------

"""
This file implements the Greedy Best-First Search (Greedy Search) algorithm for solving a game problem.
Greedy Search is a heuristic-based algorithm that prioritizes states that appear closest to the goal
based on a heuristic function. It is fast but does not guarantee finding the optimal solution.

Returns:
    - path: The list of moves if a solution is found, or [] if not.
    - nodes_explored: The number of states analyzed.
    - max_depth: The maximum depth explored within the given time limit.

    Performs Greedy Best-First Search (Greedy Search).
    It prioritizes states that appear closest to the goal based on a heuristic function.

    Args:
        initial_state (GameState): The initial state of the game.
        time_limit (int): The maximum time allowed for the search (in seconds).
        heuristic (function): The heuristic function to use for estimating the cost to the goal.

    Returns:
        tuple: (path, nodes_explored, max_depth)
            - path: A list of moves leading to the goal state, or None if no solution is found.
            - nodes_explored: The number of states explored during the search.
            - max_depth: The maximum depth reached during the search.
