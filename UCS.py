# Description: Implementation of UCS algorithm for the game.


#--------------------------------------------

"""
This file implements the Uniform Cost Search (UCS) algorithm for solving a game problem.
It explores the state space to find the path with the lowest cumulative cost (g(n)).
The implementation uses a priority queue for state management and tracks explored states
to avoid revisiting them. The algorithm guarantees finding the optimal solution if all
step costs are non-negative.

Returns:
    - path: The list of moves if a solution is found, or [] if not.
    - nodes_explored: The number of states analyzed.
    - max_depth: The maximum depth explored within the given time limit.

    """
    This function performs Uniform Cost Search (UCS).
    It finds the path with the lowest cumulative cost (g(n)).

    How does it work?
    - Uses a 'priority queue' to expand the state with the lowest cost first.
    - The cost is defined as the cumulative cost (g(n)) to reach a state.
    - Guarantees finding the optimal solution if all step costs are non-negative.

    Returns:
        - path: A list of moves if a solution is found, or [] if not.
        - nodes_explored: How many states were analyzed.
        - max_depth: The maximum depth explored.
