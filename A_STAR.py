# Description: Implementation of A* (A-Star) Search algorithm with heuristic selection.

#--------------------------------------------

"""
This file implements the A* (A-Star) Search algorithm for solving a game problem.
A* is a heuristic-based algorithm that balances the cost of reaching a state (g)
and an estimate of the cost to reach the goal (h). It guarantees finding the optimal
solution if the heuristic is admissible.

Returns:
    - path: The list of moves if a solution is found, or [] if not.
    - nodes_explored: The number of states analyzed.
    - max_depth: The maximum depth explored within the given time limit.
