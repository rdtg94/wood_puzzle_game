# Description: Implementation of Iterative Deepening Search algorithm for the game.

#--------------------------------------------

"""
This file implements the Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) algorithm for solving a game problem.
IDS combines the advantages of BFS (finding the shortest path in terms of depth) and DFS
(lower memory usage). It performs multiple depth-limited searches, increasing the depth
limit with each iteration until a solution is found or the time limit is exceeded.

Returns:
    - path: The list of moves if a solution is found, or [] if not.
    - nodes_explored_overall: The total number of states analyzed across all iterations.
    - max_depth_overall: The maximum depth explored in any iteration.

    """
    This function performs Iterative Deepening Search (IDS).
    It combines the advantages of BFS and DFS by performing multiple depth-limited searches.

    How does it work?
    - Performs multiple Depth-Limited Searches (DLS), increasing the depth limit with each iteration.
    - Starts with a small depth limit (e.g., 1).
    - If no solution is found, increases the depth limit (e.g., to 2) and repeats the DLS.
    - Continues increasing the depth limit until a solution is found or the time limit is exceeded.
    - Guarantees finding the shallowest solution (like BFS) while using less memory (like DFS).

    Returns:
        - path: A list of moves if a solution is found, or [] if not.
        - nodes_explored_overall: The total number of states analyzed across all iterations.
        - max_depth_overall: The maximum depth explored in any iteration.
