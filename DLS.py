# Description: Implementation of Depth-Limited Search (DLS) algorithm for the game.

#--------------------------------------------

"""
This file implements the Depth-Limited Search (DLS) algorithm for solving a game problem.
It explores the state space using depth-first search but limits the depth of exploration
to avoid going too deep.

    """
    This function performs Depth-Limited Search (DLS).
    It explores the state space using depth-first search with a depth limit.

    How does it work?
    - Uses recursion to explore the state space.
    - Stops exploring a branch if the depth limit is reached.
    - Returns 'cutoff' if the depth limit is reached without finding a solution.

    Returns:
        - path: A list of moves if a solution is found, or [] if not.
        - nodes_explored: How many states were analyzed.
        - max_depth_reached: The maximum depth explored.
