"""
This file implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for solving a game problem. 
It explores the state space level by level to find the shortest path to a goal state, 
defined by diamond collection. The implementation uses a queue for 
state management and tracks explored states to avoid revisiting them. The algorithm 
returns the solution path, the number of nodes explored, and the maximum depth reached 
within a given time limit.

    """
    This function performs Breadth-First Search (BFS).
    It explores the state space level by level.

    How does it work?
    - Uses a 'queue' (FIFO: First In, First Out).
    - Removes the oldest state from the queue.
    - Generates all its neighbors (states 1 move away).
    - If a neighbor has never been visited, marks it as visited and adds it to the *end* of the queue.
    - Guarantees finding the shortest path in terms of *number of moves*.
    - May use a lot of memory if the 'breadth' of the search tree is large, higher difficulties.

    Returns:
        - path: A list of moves if a solution is found, or [] if not.
        - nodes_explored: How many states were analyzed.
        - max_depth: The maximum depth explored.
